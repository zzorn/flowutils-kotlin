# flowutils-kotlin
Utility library for the Kotlin language

The goal is to collect utility functions and extension functions for things like:

* Math operations and common functions (e.g. interpolation, clamping and so on)
* String related utilities
* Checking parameter values and throwing IllegalArgument exceptions if they are out of range
* Working with physical values and constants

and other generic things that pop up and don't fit anywhere else.

Only depends on the Kotlin language and standard library (as well as the Java standard library).
